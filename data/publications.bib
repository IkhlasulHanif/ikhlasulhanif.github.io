    abstract = "This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training, evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58 across all languages."

Our system combines Whisper for transcription and NLLB for translation, with experiments concentrated mainly on the translation stage. We observe that data augmentation leads to only marginal improvements, primarily for the smaller 600M model, with gains up to 0.0026 COMET points. These gains do not extend to larger models like the 3.3B NLLB, and the overall impact appears somewhat inconsistent. In contrast, fine-tuning larger models using QLoRA outperforms full fine-tuning of smaller models. Moreover, multi-stage fine-tuning consistently improves task-specific performance across all model sizes."
